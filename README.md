## This application contains a pomodor, timer, and a stopwatch.
The purpose of making this was that I could not find a pomodoro online that allows the user to custom input the time that they want to repeat over and over. Therefore, the pomodoro in this application allows that. 

At the same time, I wanted to get better at understanding how to use react state and props. This project has a lot of data that are passed between componenets, therefore gave me exposure to how to properly use props and state to make the application.
